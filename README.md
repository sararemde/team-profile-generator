## Challenges and success
I had a busy weekend and underestimated how long it would take me to do this assignment. I would like to fix a few bugs and add some bootstrap to make the cards work/look better. Aside from that I think i got the basics of the assignment done. It's definetly is a working progress. My favorite part was doing the 'lib' folder. It was pretty easy when I found out about the "super" tag haha!

## final thoughts
Overall, the assignment was fun and I want to continue to work on it so I can submit a video of what the final product is.
